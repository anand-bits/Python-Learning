n mathematics, a distribution refers to how values of a random variable are spread or behave. Here are some key probability distributions:

1. Discrete Distributions
Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in 
𝑛
n independent Bernoulli trials with probability 
𝑝
p. Example: Tossing a coin multiple times.
Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events in a fixed interval when they occur at a constant rate. Example: Calls received at a call center per hour.
Geometric Distribution: Models the number of trials needed for the first success in repeated Bernoulli trials.
2. Continuous Distributions
Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: Bell-shaped curve, used in many natural phenomena like heights or test scores. Defined by mean 
𝜇
μ and standard deviation 
𝜎
σ.
Exponential Distribution: Models the time between independent events occurring at a constant rate. Example: Time between bus arrivals.
Uniform Distribution: All values in a range are equally likely. Example: Rolling a fair die.
